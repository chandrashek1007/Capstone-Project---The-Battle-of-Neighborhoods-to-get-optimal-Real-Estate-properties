    "New York City’s housing market has largely recovered from the financial crisis of 2008, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that buying a home here is, in the long run, a good investment. That’s the conclusion from a new report by StreetEasy, which looks at how home values in the city have changed in the 10 years since the Great Recession.\n",
    "Additionally, home values have overall gone up since the post-crisis low of November 2011. StreetEasy found that those have risen by a whopping 30 percent in the past seven years, at an average of nearly four percent per year."
