# Capstone-Project---The-Battle-of-Neighborhoods-to-get-optimal-Real-Estate-properties
The problem scenario is to suggest the homebuyers clientele to purchase a suitable real estate in New York using Machine Learning Algorithms.  As a result, the business problem we are currently posing is:  How could we provide suggestions to homebuyers clients to purchase a suitable real estate in New York street in this depreciating economy?  To solve this business problem, we are going to cluster New York neighborhoods in order to recommend venues and the current average price of real estate where homebuyers can make a real estate investment.Also we will recommend profitable venues venues i.e. pharmacy, restaurants, hospitals &amp; grocery stores.
